## Description

BirdsI is a way for companies to see the magnitude of their impact in the social media world. This will be accomplished using analytics and the Twitter API. Companies will be able to buy this service and look at how many times any aspect of their company (company name, products, executives) is tweeted about in a certain time period. This could give companies a look into how the popularity of the subject of interest may have grown, decreased, or fluctuated through a short or long time period.

Additionally, after this framework is established, BirdsI may add certain enhancements to their product. These enhancements can include differentiating between positive and negative tweets about the company/product, and delving into the popularity of specific complaints or compliments given by Twitter users. Specific keywords in tweets could be tracked to accomplish this.

## Vision Statement

To allow companies to see how tremendous they are and figure out how they can achieve their visions.

## Motivation

BirdsI will be a useful tool companies may utilize to improve their understanding of their social media presence. With the information we will provide, they may be able to alter their marketing methods in order to improve brand awareness. This improvement will in turn allow companies to grow and help them accomplish their goals. Furthermore, Twitter does not seem to make this data available to companies presently.

## Risks

- Lack of knowledge in back-end web development and in interfacing an external API
- Lack of experience in collaborative software development
- Complexity of natural language parsing
- Potential lack of need for the product
- General reliance on the Twitter API
- Lack of time for face-to-face meetings

## Risk Mitigation Plan

- Dedicate time to learning back-end development and seek out a mentor in this field. Many web tutorials exist for developing web back-ends and due to the encyclopedic nature of the internet, solutions can be readily Googled.
- The lack of collaborative experience in our team can be remedied by getting practice, using tools to facilitate, and learning how other groups have done it. It can be a bit awkward at first, but this will need to be a collaborative project.
- The lack of need for the product could just be immediate. Birdsl needs marketing campaigns and advertisement activities if it wants to be in the market, so that users will see why it’s become increasingly important to pull detailed analytics from social media.
- Problems and questions could be posted on student forums so that if anyone interested or having related skill sets and experience with Twitter API could help. Additionally, the Twitter API is rigorously documented (thank god), and most pages describing use also provide code snippets to demonstrate usage.
- Try to respect each other and save time for face-to-face meetings. There may be no fixed need to meet up for the whole group but just some who work on certain parts. 
- Complexity of natural language parsing is somewhat mitigated by the hashtag system, as well as only needing to recognize words to a certain capacity. A relatively simple dictionary of words with “positive” and “negative” connotations could at the very least function as a substitute.
- Potential lack of need for the product is moot as we’re not particularly creating this product to sell to companies; this is a class project. Regardless, twitter in and of itself does not offer very detailed analytics to companies posting on twitter, nor do they offer an overview of what people are saying about them. Although there is not necessarily a demonstrated “need” for this product, it is a product that is not currently being offered, which should be attractive to the marketing department of companies who participate in social media.
- Reliance on the twitter API is not a risk that can be really mitigated given the nature of the project. If the API is limited in function, then our project becomes limited by the API. That being said, it is sometimes possible to “hack” solutions to unique problems created by a lackluster API. This may or may not end up being a problem, only time will tell.

## Software Development Methodology

We will utilize the Agile framework for this project because of its flexibility and cross-functional collaboration advantages. We will operate in 3 week sprints working on the items selected for development from the product backlog. These items will be estimated using story points and divided among the group in order to complete the selected items. 

## Collaboration Tool

Our primary collaboration tool will be Slack.
